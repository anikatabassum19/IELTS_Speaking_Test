    We are students of United International University, studying Computer Science and Engineering.
    Recognizing the lack of opportunities for practicing English effectively, we built this app to help users enhance their speaking skills.

    Our goal is to provide a free and accessible platform for everyone to prepare for IELTS speaking tests or improve their conversational English.
